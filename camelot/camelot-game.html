		<h3 class="intro1">You and the Knights have arrived at Camelot! You have heard of it's splendor and silliness since you were a small lackey. You are not disapointed.</h3>
		<h3 class="intro2">You are at the back of the arriving party but even you can't miss the frenzy occuring in the throne room. You see some extremly talented singing and tap dancing knights dancing on a rectangle table, but they soon run out of lines to sing. Now they are just silly gits in chainmail standing on a elevated slab of wood. There is a upset rustle coming from the court, and a typical indifferent attitude coming from the servants.</h3>
		<h3 class="intro3">"Help Me", you hear from behind you. You turn around to find a servant with dirty attire (which seems to be expected from this era in general), with parchment, a quill, and a desperate expression on his face.</h3>
		<h3 class="intro4">"The court musician quit, and the song needs to be finished.  I can't read, and I'll end up in the stocks for sure.", He says. He looks really pathetic, so you decide to help.</h3>
