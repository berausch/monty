You see some extremly talented singing and tap dancing knights dancing on a rectangle table, but they soon run out of lines to sing. Now they are just silly gits in chainmail standing on a elevated slab of wood. There is a upset rustle coming from the court, and a typical indifferent attitude coming from the servants.</h3>
		<h3 class="intro3">"Help Me", you hear from behind you. You turn around to find a servant with dirty attire (which seems to be expected from this era in general), with parchment, a quill, and a desperate expression on his face.</h3>
		<h3 class="intro4">"The court musician quit, and the song needs to be finished.  I can't read, and I'll end up in the stocks for sure.", He says. He looks really pathetic, so you decide to help.</h3>
