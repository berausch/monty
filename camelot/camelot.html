		<h3>You are riding along at a steady gait when you hear the orchestra trumpets heralding the arrival of the scene about Camelot. Everyone stands in awe. "Camelot," King Arthur says with reverence.<br><br>From a distance you can't tell that the castle is only a really shabbily made model that was created with illegal Norwegian Moose labor. My friend Svenge told me that there are lovely lakes in that region. I like to swim, but only with the bitey Norewegan Moose.</h3>
